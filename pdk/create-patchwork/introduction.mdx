## What is included?

Create-patchwork extends the code generation capabilities of the Patchwork Development Kit (PDK). While smart contract generation is valuable, it’s a small piece of what is required to launch most types of onchain applications. Create-patchwork will generate the following for you automatically:

- Smart contract code
- Contract create2 deployers
- Ponder config for offchain event indexing
- Database schemas
- Ponder event handlers
- Event Hooks
- tRPC API
- React hooks
- Dockerfile for service orchestration
- Localdev with anvil

## Quickstart

Create-patchwork requires Foundry’s forge to be installed.

Once installed, you can simply run:

```shell
npx create-patchwork
```

If you didn’t provide a config file, you can choose from a provided template. **Elephants** is a template for a PFP project similar to [elephants.fun](https://elephants.fun), and **Canvas** is a collaborative art project similar to [canvas.patchwork.dev](https://canvas.patchwork.dev).

If you’d like to design your own application from scratch, you can define your entities, data model, and relationships using the Patchwork Wizard, export the project, and run it with create-patchwork:

```shell
npx create-patchwork patchwork.config.ts
```
