## Welcome

The Patchwork Development Kit provides a toolset for defining onchain metadata schemas and 
generating Patchwork-compatible contracts. Define schemas in JSON and use the PDK tool to 
validate and generate solidity.

## Workflow

1. You define a contract configuration in JSON, adding the features and metadata fields your app requires
2. You run the PDK contract generator to convert the JSON into a Solidity contract
3. You customize your solidity contract by adding your own custom logic
4. Deploy to any EVM compatible chain where Patchwork Protocol is already deployed
