description: 'The Patchwork Development Kit provides a toolset for defining onchain metadata schemas and 
generating Patchwork-compatible contracts. Define schemas in JSON and use the PDK tool to 
validate and generate solidity.'
---

## Workflow

1. Define a contract configuration in JSON, adding the features and metadata fields your app requires.
2. Run the PDK contract generator to convert the JSON into a Solidity contract.
3. Customize your solidity contract by adding your own custom logic.
4. Deploy to any EVM-compatible chain [where Patchwork Protocol is deployed](/protocol/info/networks).

  npm test
  ```

- Using Foundry:

  ```shell
  forge test
  ```

## Using the PDK

To use the Patchwork Development Kit (PDK), run:

```shell
npx pdk
```
