description: 'The Patchwork Development Kit provides a toolset for defining onchain metadata schemas and 
generating Patchwork-compatible contracts. Define schemas in JSON and use the PDK tool to 
validate and generate solidity.'
---

## Workflow

1. Define a contract configuration in JSON, adding the features and metadata fields your app requires.
2. Run the PDK contract generator to convert the JSON into a Solidity contract.
3. Customize your solidity contract by adding your own custom logic.
4. Deploy to any EVM-compatible chain [where Patchwork Protocol is deployed](/protocol/info/networks).

## Installing

In a git repository root directory, perform the following steps to prepare a project:

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Foundry">

   Foundry is a smart contract development toolchain. You can install it by following the instructions at [Foundry's installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

   ```shell
   forge install
   ```

</Step>
<Step title="Install Patchwork Contracts Library">

    ```shell
    forge install runic-inc/patchwork
    ```

</Step>
<Step title="Install OpenZeppelin Contracts">

    ```shell
    forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
    ```

</Step>
<Step title="Configure Project Remappings">

    In project directory, create the file `remappings.txt`
    ```
    @openzeppelin/=lib/openzeppelin-contracts/
    @patchwork/=lib/patchwork/src/
    forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/
    lib/=lib/
    ```

</Step>
<Step title="Install PDK">

    Option 1 - Local project installation (recommended for npm/js projects)
    ```shell
    npm i @patchworkdev/pdk
    ```

    Option 2 - Global binary installation
    ```shell
    npm i -g @patchworkdev/pdk
    ```

</Step>
