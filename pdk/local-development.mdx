title: 'Local development'

There are 5 services that comprise create-patchwork applications:

1. **Ponder** (event indexing, API)
2. **Postgres** (event persistence)
3. **Anvil**
4. **www** (React frontend)
5. **Dozzle** (container logs)

If you have Docker installed, the easiest way to run these all is using the `pdk localDev` command:

```shell
pdk dev up
```

This command will start all containers, deploy contracts to your preferred network (automatically if you are using Anvil), configure environment variables, and rerun any generators that need it because of downstream changes.

To stop development, do:

```shell
pdk dev down
```

If youâ€™d like to switch networks, you can run:

```shell
pdk network switch <network>
```

You can see a list of supported networks by running:

```shell
pdk network list
```

You can also manually rerun any generator by running them with `pdk`.

From your created project root, run `pdk` to see a list of all available commands.
