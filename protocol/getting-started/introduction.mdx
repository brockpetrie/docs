Patchwork allows metadata to be mutable and transferable, permits new data schemas to be attached to tokens, contracts, and addresses long after their creation, and enables projects to be permissionlessly extended by others. Patchwork operates entirely onchain and is fully interactable by smart contracts.

Patchwork delivers fresh utility around mutability, interoperability, and extensibility. Use it for games, provenance, attestiation, PFPs, and any domain where evolution, collaboration, and data-richness is valued.
