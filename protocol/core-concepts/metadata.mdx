Metadata is any piece or set of data that provides properties, context, or information about something. For Patchwork, that means data about onchain entities (e.g. an NFT), or data about offchain entities that are valuable to store onchain.

Take the following schema:

```json
{
  "scopeName": "foohero",
  "name": "Character",
  "symbol": "CHAR",
  "schemaURI": "https://foohero.foo/my-metadata.json",
  "imageURI": "https://foohero.foo/avatars/{tokenID}.png",
  "fields": [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "key": "character",
        "type": "char16",
        "description": "Name of character"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "key": "xp",
        "type": "uint16",
        "description": "Character experience points"
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "key": "hp",
        "type": "uint16",
        "description": "Character life"
    }
  ]
}
```
