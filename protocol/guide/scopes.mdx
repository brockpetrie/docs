title: Scopes
description: 'Scopes are application-level Patchwork namespaces for configuring settings and permissions or your app.'

When creating a new application, the first thing you'll do is create a Patchwork Scope for your app. You'll then define within that scope which contracts can mint, assign NFTs, and modify metadata. Scopes are free to claim on a first-come-first-serve basis, and can be transferred to other parties.

## Scope creation

Scopes are claimed using `PatchworkProtocol:claimScope()`. Typically you'll call this in your contracts' deploy script, but it can be manually called if desired.

<Note>When called, the owner of the claimed Scope is set to the party calling the function.</Note>

For example, this Forge deploy script claims the Scope `fooscope123`.

```solidity deploy.s.sol
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "forge-std/Script.sol";
import "@patchwork/PatchworkProtocol.sol";

contract FooDeploy is Script {
    function run() external {
        PatchworkProtocol patchworkProtocol = PatchworkProtocol(ADDRESSFORPATCHWORK);

        vm.startBroadcast();
        patchworkProtocol.claimScope("fooscope123");

        // ...rest of deploy code
    }
}
```

## Adding contracts to your Scope

Registering a contract to your Scope is a 2-part process. The first part is declaring the Scope in your contract's Patchwork721 constructor, where the first param is the name of your claimed Scope.

```solidity Foo.sol
pragma solidity ^0.8.23;

import "@patchwork/Patchwork721.sol";

contract Foo is Patchwork721 {
    constructor(address manager_, address owner_)
        Patchwork721("fooscope123", "Foo", "FOO", manager_, owner_)
    { }

    // ...rest of contract code
}
```

The second part is granting your deployed contract the relevant Scope permissions. This is typically done in your contract's deploy script.

```solidity deploy.s.sol
    patchworkProtocol.addOperator("fooscope123", address(foocontract));
    patchworkProtocol.addWhitelist("fooscope123", address(foocontract));
```
