Scopes can be configured to charge a fee for mint, assign or patch events.

Related functions:

```solidity
setMintConfiguration(address addr, MintConfig memory config)
getMintConfiguration(address addr) external view returns (MintConfig memory config)
setPatchFee(address addr, uint256 baseFee)
getPatchFee(address addr) external view returns (uint256 baseFee)
setAssignFee(address fragmentAddress, uint256 baseFee)
getAssignFee(address fragmentAddress) external view returns (uint256 baseFee)
```

All amounts in mint, assign or patch fees are base fee amounts. Patchwork Protocol will be configured to take a percentage of the base fee amount for the protocol fee. The base fee amount is what the user is charged and is split between the scope and the protocol.

Configurations are per-address. For multiple contracts, each contract address must be set explicitly.

Fees are collected and held by the protocol and are made available to withdraw at any time by the scope owner or banker.

```solidity
addBanker(string memory scopeName, address addr)
removeBanker(string memory scopeName, address addr)
withdraw(string memory scopeName, uint256 amount)
balanceOf(string memory scopeName) external view returns (uint256 balance)
```

Use `addBanker` to add a banker to your scope and you can withdraw all collected fees by calling `withdraw("myscope", balanceOf("myscope"))`
